## 👩‍💻 Common Issues

If you encounter problems, here are a few solutions:

- **Slider Not Working:** Check that you opened the `index.html` file in a web browser. Opening files directly in text editors won’t display the slider.
- **Slow Performance:** Optimize images for web by reducing their file size before adding them to the slider.
